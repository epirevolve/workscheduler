# Work Scheduler

*work scheduler* can provide fantastic experiment.


### How to

##### Administrators:
Register skills and teams only one time.\
And also register all operators by users page. Register on users page make operators info too.

And then make scheduler basic info at scheduler base setting page and also register monthly info.\
It require a number of required operators count for each day (default value can be set).\
Fixed schedule info like seminar or conference attendance can be set.

After make monthly setting, please publish its info to operators. Then operators can register their own schedule as request of holiday.\
!!!! Request of holiday can be seen by registerer only. NOT seen from administrator, so operator can get holiday easily with no stress on a day he/she has some specific schedule.

After a few days from publish, maybe operators can set their requests, can start making schedule.\
Making work schedule takes a few hours.\
Please confirm schedule is correct. This tool can't reflect all conditions and requests.\
(operators holiday requests is prior to all conditions, so holiday requests will be okay.)

Please modify and correct some day schedule and then publish schedule to operators.
